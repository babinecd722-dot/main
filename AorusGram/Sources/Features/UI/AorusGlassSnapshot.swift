// AorusGram: the glass has to survive the app switcher.
//
// The report: with Interface 2.0 on, leave the app and look at its card in the switcher, and
// the panes are there with no material in them. Open the app and the material is back.
//
// Why it happens
// --------------
// A pane is a live backdrop. On iOS 26 it is `UIVisualEffectView(effect: UIGlassEffect)`, and
// below it Telegram's `LegacyGlassView` over a private backdrop layer. Neither of them holds
// what it shows: they read the pixels behind them, in the render server, every frame they are
// drawn. The card in the switcher is one picture of the app, and by the time it is taken that
// reading has stopped.
//
// What is done about it
// ---------------------
// The screen is photographed while the material is still being drawn — on `willResignActive`,
// the last moment the app is still rendering — and each pane is given the piece of that
// photograph that covers it, placed exactly where it was taken from. It all comes down again on
// `didBecomeActive`.
//
// `drawHierarchy(in:afterScreenUpdates:)` is the capture: it asks the render server for the
// frame rather than re-running the layer tree in process, which is the difference that decides
// whether a backdrop is in it at all. (`layer.render(in:)` is the one that cannot — that is
// written down elsewhere in this fork and it cost a day to learn. Telegram takes its own
// locked-window cover with `drawHierarchy` for the same reason.)
//
// The photograph is an EXACT copy: same pixels, same scale, same place, nothing filtered.
// That is what makes it safe. Laid back over the region it came from it cannot be told apart
// from what was there — the row titles it inevitably contains land precisely on the real ones
// and disappear into them. It can only add: the one thing it holds that the card would
// otherwise lose is the material.
//
// (An earlier version blurred the photograph, on the theory that a blur would stand in for the
// material if the capture came back without it. On screen that theory was a smear across the
// whole app, which is exactly what it was. Nothing is filtered now.)
//
// When a pane moves after the picture is taken
// --------------------------------------------
// It does: a profile header re-lays itself out on the way out, and a copy left at the old place
// is the band of the wrong size that came back as a report. An earlier version answered that by
// dropping such copies — which threw away the very panes the whole thing exists for.
//
// The window's photograph is kept for as long as the copies are up, so a pane that has moved is
// re-cut from it at its new place instead. The copy follows the pane; it is never stretched,
// never left behind, and never thrown away for moving.
//
// Each photograph goes INSIDE its own pane, underneath that pane's own content, so nothing is
// covered that the pane was not already covering, and nothing is ever added above anything — a
// passcode cover, when one is put up, is the window's own and stays over everything.
