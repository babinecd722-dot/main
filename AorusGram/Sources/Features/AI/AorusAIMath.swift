/// LaTeX, as the assistant writes it, turned into something a reader can read.
///
/// What this is
/// ------------
/// A parser. Not a list of substitutions — that is what it replaces, and the substitutions
/// were why every answer came out looking like source code with the backslashes filed off:
/// `(a)/(b)` for a fraction, `√(x+1)` for a root, `^(n+1)` for an exponent, `_(x → 0)` for the
/// condition under a limit. Each of those is what you write when you cannot draw the thing.
///
/// So the maths is parsed into a tree — fractions, roots, scripts, operators with limits,
/// delimiters that have to grow with what is inside them, and the rows of a system or a
/// matrix — and the tree is handed to `AorusAIMathTypesetter`, which draws it. Everything
/// around the maths stays text a reader can select, and anything that reads perfectly well as
/// text still is text: ½ is a character, `x²` is a character, `∫₀¹` is three.
///
/// Why it lives here, in the core module, with no UIKit in it
/// ----------------------------------------------------------
/// So it compiles and runs on its own. The preflight puts the whole of it through real model
/// output in about two seconds, instead of the hour a full build costs.
