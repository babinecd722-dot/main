// resolved handle is, how a handle is found in text, how the text the user actually wrote
// is recovered from a rendering that shows people instead of handles, and what this
// session has already looked up.
//
// It lives in the core module rather than next to the views so the release preflight can
// typecheck it and run tests against it. The regex that decides what counts as a handle,
// and the walk that turns pills back into the string the transport sends, are the two
// pieces where being subtly wrong is both easy and invisible.
