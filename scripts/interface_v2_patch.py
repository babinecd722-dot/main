"""Interface 2.0: native glass, centred header, frosted placeholders.

Everything here restyles code Telegram already ships rather than drawing a replacement.
The glass is Telegram's own `GlassBackgroundView`, which resolves to `UIGlassEffect(style:
.regular)` on the iOS 26 SDK and to its `LegacyGlassView` below it. That matters for three
reasons: it is the actual system material rather than a blur with a white sheen painted on
top, it needs no SDK shims of ours, and it already answers to the fork's global glass
toggle. `TintColor(kind: .clear)` is the variant with no tint, no rim and no inner fill.

Anchors in this file were checked byte for byte against Telegram-iOS at the pinned commit.
A missing one raises, which fails the build in seconds instead of an hour into compilation.

/// paints anything over that material flattens it back into the opaque panel it used to be.
///
/// Which leaves the problem of knowing where the runs are, and there is no answer to that in any one
/// place -- a block is however many consecutive rows happen to share a section id, and each of those
/// rows is drawn by one of dozens of item classes spread across the app. So the fill becomes a
/// marker instead of a colour. Every blocks-style row in Telegram fills its background node with
/// `itemBlocksBackgroundColor`, so handing them this colour makes the nodes wearing it exactly the
/// set of card rectangles, already laid out, already overlapping their neighbours by the hairline
/// that joins them. `ItemListControllerNode` reads them back and groups them.
///
/// It is a colour rather than a flag because a colour is what those hundreds of assignments already
/// pass around, and it is 1/255 of an alpha rather than `.clear` because `.clear` is a value plenty

    Stock can keep those two apart because the fill is always the accent and the foreground always

    own ink so that accent-coloured *text* stays legible on glass -- and a pill filled with white ink

    is there, drawn white on white, readable only as the shape it leaves in the pane.

    draw a badge from the list theme. `aorusBadgeForegroundColor(over:)` answers with the stock

    A peer with no photo gets initials on one of Telegram's fixed colour gradients, drawn into
    an image by AvatarNode. Interface 2.0 wants those initials on glass instead -- in the chat
    list, in search, in the contact list and in the profile. All four draw through this one
    routine, so all four change together, and because it stays a drawn image there is no
    per-row effect view and no cost to scrolling.

    A drawn frost is as close to glass as a rasterised image gets, and for a row 40 points tall
    it is indistinguishable. At the size the profile header draws it, it is not: it reads as a
    dimmed disc, which is the complaint. So the node also takes a switch -- set only by the
    profile header, which puts one real GlassBackgroundView behind that one avatar -- that stops
    the plate being drawn at all and leaves just the initials over the material.

    It is not an action sheet, which is why the pass above never reached it. `ShareControllerNode`
    draws its own card out of stretchable images it generates in its initialiser: a rounded rectangle
    behind the peer grid, the same rectangle with its top squared off behind the comment field and
    the send button, and a third copy of the first behind Cancel -- all filled with
    `opaqueItemBackgroundColor`. So under Interface 2.0 this was the last plainly opaque panel left in
    the client, and it is the one a profile puts on screen most often.

    Three panes, then, one per shape, and the fills they take over go clear rather than being deleted.
    The highlighted pair stays a colour: Cancel and Send still have to answer a finger, and a
    translucent wash over the material is how the action sheets already answer one.

    Two of the panes live inside the node that used to hold the card's image, and the third inside
    Cancel's, which is what keeps all three in place for nothing: those are the nodes the sheet
    already moves. A view of our own tracking three frames would have to be told about the drag, the
    keyboard, the peer that was just selected and the search that was just opened, and told again
    every time upstream changes one of them.

    The card's pane stops where the strip's begins instead of running the height of the card. Glass
    over glass comes out brighter than either, and a sheet with a brighter rectangle across its foot
    reads as a bug; two panes tiling the card exactly read as the footer it is. Leaving the strip
    clear is not an option in the other direction -- the peer grid scrolls underneath it, which is
    why Telegram's own strip there is opaque to begin with. Which is also why the strip's pane hangs
    off the card and not off the node whose fill it replaces: that node is faded out while a search

    """Let a collapsed header scroll away at its own size instead of folding into the navigation bar.

    This pass is about the header a peer with no photo gets. Interface 2.0 opens a profile with a
    photo at full width -- see `_patch_keep_avatar_expanded`, which is what keeps it there -- and
    the letter placeholder cannot be expanded into anything, so those profiles open in Telegram's
    collapsed arrangement: the round avatar above a centred name.

    In that arrangement stock shrinks the avatar to 0.55 and locks the name under the status bar
    the moment the list moves, which turns the header from content into chrome. Holding the
    collapse fraction at zero leaves every size alone and lets the whole header travel with the
    list: `avatarScale` becomes 1, `avatarOffset` and `apparentTitleLockOffset` become 0, and
    the offset applied to the three labels becomes the scroll offset itself. The avatar then
    slides up behind the dynamic island through the clipping node that is already there, and
    the labels, which have no such node, fade over the last stretch before they would be drawn
    across the status bar.

    Only the collapsed branch is touched. The expanded one keeps stock's fraction on purpose: it
    is what hands the name to the navigation bar as the photo scrolls past it, and the photo
    itself is not sized from that fraction, so nothing shrinks there either.

    Settings keeps the stock header: its own avatar is small and it has no photo to preserve.

    """Keep the photo at full width, and never expand one that is not there.

    Interface 2.0 opens a profile on the photo itself, edge to edge, because that photo is what
    the page under the whole screen takes its colour from: the page continues the colour the
    photo ends in, so the two have to meet. scripts/profile_personalization_patch.py opens the
    header in that state; this pass is what stops the screen from immediately taking it back.

    Eight places take it back, and each is a different reason.

    Telegram collapses the expanded photo as soon as the list scrolls a single point, which is
    what would make the photo snap into the corner on the first touch. It stays expanded and
    simply scrolls away instead -- nothing is pinned and no offset is faked, the header keeps
    the size it was drawn at.

    Four more collapse it to bring the tab strip to the top of the screen: choosing a tab,
    the panes asking for the strip to be expanded, scrolling a selection into view, and the
    controller's own expandTabs. All four already scroll the content afterwards, which is the
    part that was wanted; shrinking the photo as well is what made tapping Media snap it into
    the corner. Each asks the shared test below first.

    The header is built before the peer is loaded, so the flag alone cannot tell whether there
    is a photo to expand, and expanding a profile that has none is what breaks its layout. That
    is corrected on the pass that first learns there is no photo.

    Coming back from the avatar gallery and cancelling an edit both collapse the header
    deliberately, and both have to hand the photo back afterwards, because Interface 2.0 never
    opens on a small one and offers no way back to the big one except dragging.

    Every other pane in a profile goes transparent under Interface 2.0 and lets the page show

    blocks: it is two opaque rectangles instead of a row background. A rounded one tinted with
    `itemBlocksBackgroundColor` behind the list, and a second one above it -- white everywhere
    except a rounded hole punched in the middle -- tinted with the page colour so that the hole
    reads as the block's shape. That second rectangle is the black frame around the members list,
    the 16pt gutter down each side and the four corners the radius leaves out.

    Turning it off is not an option: the hole is what keeps the first row's avatar inside the
    block's rounded corner, and the tap highlight, which runs the full width of a row, inside its
    sides. So it goes on painting -- the page instead of the theme.

    Which is two different things, because the page has two forms. For a peer with no photo the
    page is a flat colour, and it is `blocksBackgroundColor`, the very colour this mask already
    uses: nothing to change. For a peer with a photo the page is Telegram's own bottom blur block
    kept as one row and stretched over the whole screen, so there the mask stops painting and
    becomes the mask of a view holding that same row -- laid over the screen backdrop's own
    rectangle, converted into this pane's coordinates. Not over the pane's bounds: the two are
    stretched to different heights, and anything with a gradient down it would meet itself at the
    pane's top edge as a join.

def _patch_groups_pane_glass(tg: Path) -> None:
    """Give the groups tab the same glass the members tab has, instead of a black rectangle.

    This is the tab a bot's profile calls "Groups" -- the groups it has been added to -- and on any
    other peer the groups you have in common. It is built the way the members tab is built, out of
    the same two opaque rectangles: a rounded one behind the list and a second one above it with a
    rounded hole punched in the middle, so the hole reads as the block's shape and keeps the first
    row's avatar inside its corner. Everything `_patch_members_pane_glass` says about why those two
    cannot simply be turned off applies here word for word, and so does what it does about it: the
    card becomes real glass at the same 26, and the frame around it paints the page.

    What is different is the rows, and it is the whole of what was reported. The members tab is
    built from `ContactsPeerItem` with `systemStyle: .glass`, which paints no fill of its own; this
    one is built from `ItemListPeerItem` at `style: .plain`, which paints `plainBackgroundColor`
    behind every row -- pure black under the dark theme. So the rows covered the card, corners and
    all, and the tab came out as the black rectangle the reader photographed. Even upstream that is
    a rough edge: black rows over a near-black card. Here they stop painting a fill entirely
    (`displayBackground: false`) and take the glass style's own metrics, which is what puts their
    height and their separator insets where the members tab already has them.

    The rows also have to be told when the ink changes. This pane has no `presentationDataPromise`
    to push a theme through -- its rows are built by `updatePeers` out of `currentParams` -- so the
    derived theme is routed in at the top of `update`, and the entry carries the page it was built
    for so that the list's merge can see a swipe to a paler photo as a change worth rebuilding.

def _patch_recommended_pane_glass(tg: Path) -> None:
    """The same black rows, one tab over: "Similar channels" and "Similar bots".

    Found by looking for the rest of the fault `_patch_groups_pane_glass` fixes rather than waiting
    for it to be reported -- an `ItemListPeerItem` at `style: .plain` inside a profile pane, which
    paints `plainBackgroundColor` behind every row and so paints black over the page.

    It needs much less than the groups tab does, because upstream gives it no card: the rows run
    edge to edge over the pane's own background, and that background is already the page, because
    the pane container above it goes transparent under Interface 2.0. So there is no glass to lay
    and no rounded hole to keep an avatar out of -- only the fill to stop painting, the glass row
    metrics to match the rest of the profile, and the ink.

    The ink is free here. This entry already carries the theme it was built with and compares it by
    identity, which is exactly the test a derived theme answers: deriving for the other ink returns
    a different object, so routing the derived theme in at the top of `update` is enough for the
    list's merge to see a swipe to a paler photo as a change and rebuild the rows in readable
    colours. The pane's own promise carries it the rest of the way, which is also how a swipe is
    answered while nobody is laying this pane out -- the notification re-pushes it.

    Stock chooses between two badges. A plain header gets the accent-blue one with the level

    2.0 leaves the header in the second situation permanently -- the page is the colour the photo
    ends on whether or not the photo itself is open -- so the blue one, sized and shaped for a
    theme-coloured header, is the wrong one on every profile.

    A clear foreground is not an invisible number. `PeerInfoRatingComponent` switches to `.copy`

    the white badge legible against a page it knows nothing about.

    Stock picks the header's palette from what is behind it, and it only knows two answers: the
    theme's own accent and primary text when the header sits on the theme background, white when the
    photo is expanded or the peer has a profile colour or a gift status. Interface 2.0 gives it a
    third case it has no branch for -- a page painted with the avatar's own colour -- and a peer
    with neither a profile colour nor an expanded photo lands on the first answer: near-black text
    on that page.

    The saved-music capsule is where it shows most, because it is laid out from `isOverlay`, which
    asks the same question: a peer with music gets the track in the theme's accent blue and the
    artist in the theme's grey, sitting on the avatar's colour, while a peer with nothing there
    keeps the white name above it. That is the reading of "labels take the theme colour where there
    is music, white where there is not".

    So the theme-coloured ends of all three pairs go white under Interface 2.0, and the two capsule
    fills that carried them go to the same white-on-glass the expanded state uses -- both ends, not
    just the text, or a white label lands on a white card in the light theme. Only the values change;
    which branch runs is left alone, because that is also what decides whether the navigation bar may
    take the title over, and a profile that scrolls has to keep doing that.

    Stock treats the expanded photo as a backdrop rather than as part of the page, and does three

    the list slides over a picture that drifts the other way. It scales the photo up while the list
    is pulled past its top, so the picture stretches and its centre creeps downwards. And on a
    dynamic-island device it masks the photo into the island and fades a black cover in over it as
    the offset grows, so the top of the picture darkens on the way out.

    Under Interface 2.0 all three go. What is left is the frame the layout already computes minus
    the content offset, exactly once -- the same arithmetic the title, the status and the buttons
    above it already use, which is why they now travel together instead of sliding apart.

    The mask branch is skipped rather than emptied, and its `else` gains the one line that branch
    owned outright: the top shadow's visibility. Everything else in there only ever set the covers
    and the mask, which the `else` already clears.

    The player a tap on the profile's music pill opens is built out of four opaque fills: a backdrop
    behind the playlist, a 16pt strip down each side of it, a band behind the header, and a flat panel
    across the bottom with a shadow over it that the controls stand in. Under Interface 2.0 all four go
    clear and one `GlassBackgroundView` runs from the top of the modal to the bottom of the screen.

    One pane and not four. Glass over glass comes out brighter than either, so a player with a pane
    per fill would have a bright rectangle across its foot where the controls overlap the playlist,
    and a brighter band at the top where the header does. One pane also means the seams between those
    fills stop existing rather than being painted over: the wedges Telegram draws to round the
    playlist's top corners into the header band are hidden here, because they are painted in the
    modal's own colour and there is no such colour any more.

    The pane is laid out from both places that move the player -- the layout pass, which is what runs
    when it opens, and the floating-header pass, which is what moves the top edge as the playlist is
    dragged. It goes in below everything the content node holds, so the playlist, the header buttons
    and the controls all stay above the material rather than through it.

    "Добавить в профиль" was the one control left in the player wearing a colour that belonged to no
    surface behind it -- the accent fill, over glass. It becomes the page's ink, white on a dark theme
    and near-black on a light one, with its label and glyph in the inverse: the pair the profile's own
    header buttons already use. The remove state keeps its own translucent fill, which reads over the

    """Teach the scrubbing node to draw its line as a wave, and leave every colour where it was.

    The music player's position line is a 7pt bar: a stretchable rounded rectangle in the background
    colour, a second rectangle in the foreground colour, and a clipping node over the second one whose
    width is the progress. Interface 2.0 asks for a wave in the same two colours -- the shape changes
    and nothing else does.

    Off by default, and set from one place. Every other scrubber in the app -- the video player, the
    voice message, the chat's own music panel -- is a bar and stays one, so this is a property rather
    than a change to what `.standard` means; adding a case to that enum would have to be answered at
    every construction site in the client.

    Drawn at the width it is laid out at rather than tiled. A layer stretches an image, it does not
    repeat one, and a stretched wave is a different wave: the crests slide off the ones behind them.
    So the pair of images is regenerated when the size or the colours change, which for a player
    already on screen is never -- the layout pass runs on every frame of playback, and the key below
    is what keeps it from redrawing two images sixty times a second.

    The played part is the same wave in the other colour, clipped by the foreground node. Both images
    are generated for the same size and pinned to the same left edge, so a crest sits exactly over the
    crest behind it however far along the track is, and the cut edge falls wherever the playhead is --
    which is what a played waveform looks like everywhere else in the app.

    """Take the tablet out from behind the chat's title and its avatar, and leave the rest.

    A chat's navigation bar has three panes of glass in it: one behind the back button, one behind
    the name and status, and one behind whatever is on the right -- in a chat, the peer's avatar, or
    the ghost-mode badge that replaces it. Interface 2.0 keeps the first and drops the other two, so
    the name reads straight off the wallpaper and the avatar is a photo rather than a photo in a
    lozenge.

    The right-hand pane is shared with every text button in the app -- Edit, Done, Cancel, Select --
    and those keep theirs, because a bare word floating in a navigation bar has nothing to say it is
    a button. `singleCustomNode` is exactly that distinction: it is non-nil only for a bar item built
    from a display node of its own, which the avatar and the ghost badge are and a title button is
    not.

    The title pane is written twice over, because there are two title views. `ChatTitleView` is the
    older one and still carries a `backgroundView` of its own; the one a chat actually installs is
    `ChatNavigationBarTitleView`, whose pane belongs to the `ChatTitleComponent` inside it. Hiding
    only the first is why the capsule under the name survived a build that took the avatar's away.

    Upstream centres a switch row's icon on the whole content block: with a status line present its

    stands for the row, and wrong for a *status* glyph that stands for the title beside it -- it
    reads as crooked, roughly half the status line's height low.

    The second half is the turning. A row whose status is "connecting" needs the same indefinite
    spinner the rest of Telegram uses, and the row already has an icon slot in exactly the right
    place; giving that slot Telegram's own rotation is a great deal less invasive than threading an

    parameter: `transform.rotation.z` from 0 to 2*pi, half a second, linear, forever.

# alpha: on an opaque card that reads as "this row is the block, only fainter". Under glass the
# card has no colour of its own -- it is the marker -- and `withAlphaComponent` keeps a colour's
# hue while replacing only its alpha, so the expression does not fade the marker, it makes it
# opaque enough to see: a slab at 60% that hides the material underneath. That is what put a pink
# rectangle over an administrator's default-granted rights -- `ItemListExpandableSwitchItem`
# disables those rows, and its wash took the marker from 1/255 to 153/255. With the marker
# neutralised the slab is ink rather than magenta, which is the right colour and still far too
# much of it.
#
# `AorusGlassPane.rowWash` restates the intent instead of the mechanism: over a real card it is
# still `withAlphaComponent`, byte for byte what upstream did; over the marker it returns a scrim
# shallow enough to leave the glass visible through the dimmed row. Each site hands it the ink
# beside it, which is why the receiver differs from file to file.

    are right by construction now that it carries the page's ink: upstream's card is near-black on
    a dark theme and near-white on a light one, so a derivation that amplifies black or white lands
    within a shade of where upstream aimed it. These nine are the ones where landing on upstream's
