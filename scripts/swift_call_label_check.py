"""Calls to our own methods must use argument labels those methods actually have.

Why this exists
---------------
The preflight can only PARSE the AorusGramUI sources — type-checking one needs the whole
module graph behind it, which is the hour-long Bazel build. A file that is syntactically
perfect and semantically broken goes straight through, and the build is what notices.

Changing a method's signature and missing one caller is the commonest way to land in that
hole. It happened here: `deletedMessages(peerId:)` became `deletedMessages(accountKey:peerId:)`
and a caller three functions further down the same file still said `deletedMessages(for:)`.
Nothing short of a type-checker sees that — except this, which only has to compare labels.

What it checks, and what it deliberately does not
-------------------------------------------------
Only calls whose target is unambiguous:

  * an unqualified `name(...)` inside a type that declares `name`, or in a file that declares
    it at top level;
  * `TypeName.shared.name(...)` and `TypeName.name(...)`, where `TypeName` is one of ours.

A call is reported only when the name IS declared on that target and NO overload of it accepts
the labels written. A name we never declare is somebody else's and is not our business; a
label set that matches any overload is fine. Parameters with defaults may be omitted, so every
subset that keeps the required ones is accepted.

Run it by hand, or let the preflight run it:
