"""Every `swiftc` invocation in the workflow must list the files its sources need.

Run 489 died here. `AorusAIClient.swift` was added to a type-check that listed the AI models
it decodes into — and nothing else. The file also signs every request, so it names the key
provider, the fingerprint, the pinned session delegate and the environment guard, none of
which were on the list. Twenty-three `cannot find X in scope` errors, two minutes in, on a
step whose whole purpose is to find errors early.

There is no Swift compiler on this machine, so the only way to catch that before CI is to do
the bookkeeping the compiler would have done: for every `swiftc` command in the workflow,
take the files it lists, find the AorusGram types they mention, and check each one is
declared in a file the same command lists.

Only our own types are checked. Anything from the SDK or from Telegram's modules is out of
scope: those come from `-sdk` and from Bazel, and guessing at that list is how a check starts
reporting things that are fine. Our types are the ones that have to be passed in by hand, and
they are exactly the ones that were missing.

The same bookkeeping answers the opposite question too. Run 529 died on a name declared
twice: a new public `AorusPluginIcons` in the plugin core and an older private enum of the
same name in the plugin screens, compiled together by the UI type-check. Each file was fine
on its own. So every top-level type or value is also checked against the other files of its
command: two files may share a name only when both keep it `private` to themselves.
