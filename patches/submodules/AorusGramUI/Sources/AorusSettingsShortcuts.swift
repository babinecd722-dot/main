/// open settings, the plugin API among them, has the same problem and no way to solve it.

/// So the settings list, which is built in a module that *can* see all three, leaves the
/// recipe here on its way past. Asking for a screen nobody has registered yet answers nil
/// rather than a screen missing two of its rows.
