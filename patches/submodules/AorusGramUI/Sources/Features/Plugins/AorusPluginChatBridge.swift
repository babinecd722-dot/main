// The open chat, as a plugin can reach it.
//
// Everything a plugin does with the chat it is looking at has to go through the controller
// that is actually on screen, and that controller lives in TelegramUI — a module this one
// cannot import, because TelegramUI imports this one. So the shape of what is needed is
// declared here as a protocol, TelegramUI supplies an adapter that conforms to it, and the
// chat registers itself while it is on screen and withdraws when it leaves.
//
// The consequence is the one from the API documentation: chat calls answer while a chat is
// open and refuse the moment it is not. That is not a limitation to work around — it is
// what "the current chat" means.

/// What the open chat can do for a plugin. Implemented in TelegramUI by a small adapter
/// over the chat controller; nothing here knows what a chat controller is.
