// Anywhere a Telegram handle appears inside AorusAI — the text the user is typing, the
// message they sent, the answer the model wrote back, a quoted message — it is drawn as
// the person rather than as a string: their avatar in a small ringed circle, followed by
// the name from their profile in the accent colour.
//
// The handle is replaced *in place*, in the run of the sentence. An earlier revision cut
// the handle out of the text and listed the peers in a separate scrolling strip below the
// bubble, which left the sentence with a hole in it ("расскажи про" — chip) and put the
// person somewhere the eye does not read them.
//
// The characters the user typed are never lost: every pill carries its own source text in
// an attribute, and `aorusAIPlainText` walks those attributes to rebuild exactly what was
// written. That string — not what is on screen — is what the composer sends, so the
// transport is byte-for-byte what it was before the pill existed.
//
// What a mention *is*, how one is found in text and how that reconstruction works live in
// the AorusGram core module, where the preflight can typecheck them and run tests against
// them. This file is only the drawing.
