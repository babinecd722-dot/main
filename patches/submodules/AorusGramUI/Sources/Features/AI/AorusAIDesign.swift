/// Every one of them is derived from the Telegram theme the user is actually running.
/// An earlier revision carried its own palette — a fixed violet accent on a fixed near
/// black page — and the result was a screen that belonged to a different application:
/// its accent disagreed with every other button in the app, and someone on a light theme,
/// or on one of the custom themes Telegram ships, opened AorusAI into a colour scheme
/// they had never chosen.
///
/// So there are no literal colours here at all. The accent is `itemAccentColor`, which is
/// the blue of a stock theme and whatever the user picked otherwise; the page and the
/// cards are the same two surfaces every grouped list in Telegram is built from; and the
/// fills are the label colour at a low alpha, which is how the system's own secondary
/// fills are defined and is therefore correct in a theme nobody has written yet.
