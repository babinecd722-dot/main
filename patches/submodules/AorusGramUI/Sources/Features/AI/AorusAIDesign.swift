/// they had never chosen.
///
/// So there are no literal colours here at all. The accent is `itemAccentColor`, which is
/// the blue of a stock theme and whatever the user picked otherwise; the page and the
/// cards are the same two surfaces every grouped list in Telegram is built from; and the
/// fills are the label colour at a low alpha, which is how the system's own secondary
